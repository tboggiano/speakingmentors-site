We are a bunch of experienced speakers who freely and without caveats offer our time to support first-time speakers to deliver their first few sessions at tech meetups and/or conferences.

If you would like help to start your speaking career you can contact any of us using the details on our personal pages. You can find our pages in the menu above or by clicking our names in the slider below.

Please [read this information about becoming a mentor](https://www.speakingmentors.com/become-a-mentor/) if you are interested in offering your own time to mentor others.
