All mentors and anyone seeking mentoring through this site are required to agree with the following code of conduct. DLM Consultants (who host this site) will enforce this code as long as this site is live. We expect cooperation from all participants, to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

## The Short Version (if you read nothing else, please read this)

Speaking Mentors is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any correspondence, and will not be tolerated from any participant of Speaking Mentors. If at any point you feel this code of conduct is not being followed, please let DLM Consultants staff know immediately. You can contact DLM Consultants at enquiries@dlmconsultants.com.

## The Slightly Longer Version

We do not tolerate harassment of Speaking Mentors participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any correspondence relating to Speaking Mentors. Mentors violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from the website at the discretion of DLM Consultants. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Mentors and those being Mentored are all subject to this Code of Conduct. It is not appropriate for either party to use sexualized images, activities, or other material, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, DLM Consultants may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Speaking Mentors.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of DLM Consultants immediately. DLM Consultants can be contacted at [enquiries@dlmconsultants.com](emailto:enquiries@dlmconsultants.com). DLM Consultants staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their use of Speaking Mentors.

We value your contributions. We expect participants to follow these rules in all correspondence through Speaking Mentors.
